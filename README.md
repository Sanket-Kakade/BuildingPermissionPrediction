# BuildingPermissionPrediction
This is my first upload on GitHub. So please bare with the naive mistakes I may commit. 

This was one of the coding challenge I received from the coding platform.

The problem statement was to predict the category of use or occupancy where the work is proposed, given the informaton about the property and ite permit. The category was commercial, institutional, multifamily and single family.  
From the machine learning outsey, it was a multiclass classification problem. You can read more about the explanatory variable and its description in the Instruction.xlsx file.
